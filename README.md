#### Description
- This project is an iOS Countdown Timer written with UIKit and Swift
- The code is located in the ViewController.swift file
- I incorporated elements of proper Swift design (IBOutlets and IBActions, didSet state manipulation, guard statements, and viewcontroller lifecycle) to build my app
- The timer is designed to start, pause, resume, and reset the timer at the user's command
- The timer is designed to show an alert once the timer ends and prompt the user to reinitiate the timer
- The timer only accepts numerical numbers
- The timer formats the number of seconds for the timer to a user-friendly format of hours, minutes, and seconds
